 <p>
 This tab is used to configure channel tags.
 Tags are used to define a set of channels.
 Notice that nothing prohibits a channel to be a member of multiple tags.
 Also, there is no requirement to configure tags for running Tvheadend 
 itself. It is, however, required if you run Tvheadend together with Showtime.
 <p>
 The tag-sets are used for:
 <ul>
  <li>Searches in the EPG.
  <li>Display of channel groups in the Showtime Media player.
 </ul>

 <p>
 The tags are listed / edited  in a grid. 

 <ul>
  <li>To edit a cell, double click on it. After a cell is changed it
      will flags one of its corner to red to indicated that it has been
      changed. To commit these changes back to Tvheadend press the 
      'Save changes' button. In order to change a Checkbox cell you only
      have to click once in it.

  <li>To add a new entry, press the 'Add entry' button. The new (empty) entry
      will be created on the server but will not be in its enabled state.
      You can now change all the cells to the desired values, check the
      'enable' box and then press 'Save changes' to activate the new entry.

  <li>To delete one or more entries, select the lines (by clicking once on 
      them), and press the 'Delete selected' button. A pop up
      will ask you to confirm your request.
 </ul>

 <p>
 The columns have the following functions:

 <dl>
  <dt>Enabled
  <dd>Make the tag available in the rest of the system. If the tag is
      not enabled it is only presented in this grid for the administrator.

  <dt>Name
  <dd>Name of the tag. Changing the tag name does not interfere with any
      automatic recordings, groups, etc.

  <dt>Internal
  <dd>Tags are exported via HTSP (to the Showtime Media player) and used
      there for grouping of TV channels. If you do not wish to export a
      tag you can flag it as internal only.

  <dt>Icon
  <dd>Full path to an icon used to depict the tag. This can be a TV network
      logotype, etc.

  <dt>Icon has title
  <dd>If set, presentation of the tag icon will not superimpose the tag
      name on top of the icon.

  <dt>Comment
  <dd>Allows the administrator to set a comment only visible in this editor.
      It does not serve any active purpose.
