 <dt>Why does Tvheadend deliver data over TCP to Showtime? I thought it was
     bad to use TCP for realtime sensitive traffic?

 <dd>
 'HTSP' - the protocol used for streaming TV, sending meta information
 updates and RPC between Tvheadend and Showtime uses a transmission
 scheduler with multiple queues on the Tvheadend side. This means that
 Tvheadend can measure the available bandwidth between itself and the
 mediaplayer and when congestion happens it's even capable of dropping
 less important data (such as B-frames). HTSP has been tested over WAN
 links and DSL connections with zero picture/audio artifacts.
 <p>
 It's possible to get view drop statistics and bitrates directly in
 Showtime.  (Open the menu when watching a TV-channel and switch on
 'Detailed Information')
